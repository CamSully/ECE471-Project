2. Reboot
3. Connect servo motor to the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
4. Run one of the servo C code executables.

Code file descriptions:
- servo.c - This is the main servo code that is executed by the master python script.
- servo.py - This is some backup servo code used to test its functionality.
- servo0.c, servo90.c, servoNeg90.c - These files are used to manually test the Pi's rotation angles.
